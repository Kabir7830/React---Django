# React---Django
This is to explain how you can build backend in Django and front-end in React JS and connect them both together

# Creating Back-end in Django

install python and add it to the path variable
install the following dependencies for your backend in Django

  pip install django==4.1
  pip install mysqlclient
  pip install django-mysql
  pip install pillow
  pip install django-restframework
  pip install restframeworksimple_jwt


## After installing the dependencies create your project in a repo

  django-admin startproject project_name

Now move to your project directory and create a new app named backend

  cd project_name
  python manage.py startapp backend
